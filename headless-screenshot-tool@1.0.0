🤖 Bot Detection Testing Framework - Demo
======================================================================

📋 Test: Visit example.com (legitimate user behavior)
   Environment: Public test site
   Expected: Should be allowed (no bot detection)

🌐 Launching browser (headed mode - visible)...
📍 Navigating to example.com...
📸 Taking screenshot...
💾 Saving session state...
📄 Page title: Example Domain

✅ Test completed successfully!
   Screenshot: bot_test_artifacts/demo_test.png
   Session: bot_test_artifacts/demo_session.json

✅ No bot detection - legitimate user behavior

🔒 Closing browser...

======================================================================
🎯 Demo Complete!

📊 This demonstrates:
   ✅ Headed mode (visible browser)
   ✅ Human-like pacing (slow_mo)
   ✅ Artifact capture (screenshots, session)
   ✅ Bot detection checking
   ✅ Ethical testing (no evasion)

📊 Analysis:
   • If all tests failed with HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR:
     → Zomato is blocking automated browsers at network level
     → This is a TRUE POSITIVE for bot detection
     → Your bot detection system is working!

   • If some tests passed:
     → Try the successful configuration in your scenarios

   • Recommendation:
     → Use a different test site (example.com, httpbin.org)
     → Or test Zomato with authorization from their team

🚀 Using Rebrowser Playwright (with stealth patches)

======================================================================
🥷 Advanced Stealth Test: Zomato
======================================================================

🔧 Launching browser with stealth configuration...
✅ Browser launched with stealth configuration
   • Headless: False (visible browser)
   • User Agent: Chrome 131 on macOS
   • Viewport: 1920x1080
   • Automation flags: Disabled
   • Navigator.webdriver: Hidden

1️⃣  Test 1: Direct navigation to Zomato...
   ✅ Navigation successful!
   📊 Status: 200
   📄 Title: THE 10 BEST Restaurants Near Me | Zomato
   🔗 URL: https://www.zomato.com/restaurants-near-me
   📸 Screenshot saved: bot_test_artifacts/zomato_stealth_test1.png
   ✅ No obvious bot detection indicators

2️⃣  Test 2: Visit homepage first, then navigate...
   📍 Loading homepage: https://www.zomato.com
   ✅ Homepage loaded: Zomato
   📍 Navigating to: https://www.zomato.com/restaurants-near-me
   ✅ Target page loaded: THE 10 BEST Restaurants Near Me | Zomato
   📸 Screenshot saved: bot_test_artifacts/zomato_stealth_test2.png

======================================================================
🏁 Stealth testing complete!
======================================================================

📊 Results:
   • Check screenshots in bot_test_artifacts/
   • If Test 1 failed: Network-level bot detection
   • If Test 2 worked: Homepage visit helps establish session

💡 Next steps:
   • If both failed: Zomato has strong bot detection
   • If one worked: Use that approach in your scenarios
   • Consider: Getting authorization from Zomato for testing

🧪 Testing Zomato Bot Detection
================================================================================

URL: https://www.zomato.com/restaurants-near-me

Test 1: Headless (no stealth)
----------------------------------------
❌ BLOCKED - Error: Page.goto: net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR at https://www.zomato.com/restaurants-near-me
Call log:
  - navigating to "https://www.zomato.com/restaurants-near-me", waiting until "domcontentloaded"

   🔍 Detection: HTTP/2 Protocol Fingerprinting

Test 2: Headless + Stealth
----------------------------------------
❌ BLOCKED - Error: Page.goto: net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR at https://www.zomato.com/restaurants-near-me
Call log:
  - navigating to "https://www.zomato.com/restaurants-near-me", waiting until "domcontentloaded"

   🔍 Detection: HTTP/2 Protocol Fingerprinting

Test 3: Real Browser (Headed) + Stealth
----------------------------------------
✅ SUCCESS - Status: 200

================================================================================
📊 SUMMARY
================================================================================

Zomato is using one or more of these detection methods:
1. HTTP/2 Protocol Fingerprinting - Detects headless browsers at network level
2. TLS Fingerprinting - Analyzes SSL/TLS handshake patterns
3. Browser Fingerprinting - Checks WebGL, Canvas, Fonts, etc.
4. Behavioral Analysis - Monitors mouse movements, timing, etc.
5. IP/Network Blocking - Blocks known datacenter IPs

If all tests failed with HTTP2 error, Zomato is using network-level detection
which is very difficult to bypass without residential proxies.
